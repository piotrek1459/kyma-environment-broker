# Service Binding Cleanup CronJob

Use Service Binding Cleanup CronJob to remove expired service bindings for SAP BTP, Kyma runtime instances.

## Details

For each expired service binding, a DELETE request is sent to Kyma Environment Broker (KEB). The request has a time limit and can be retried if it times out.

### Dry-Run Mode

If you need to test the Job, run it in dry-run mode.
In this mode, the Job only logs the information about the number of expired service bindings without sending DELETE requests to KEB.

## Prerequisites

* The KEB database to get the IDs of expired service bindings
* KEB to initiate the service binding deletion process

## Configuration

The Job is a CronJob with a schedule that can be configured as a value in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma-environment-broker/blob/main/resources/keb/values.yaml) file for the chart (see [Schedule syntax](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#schedule-syntax)).
By default, the CronJob is scheduled as follows:

```yaml  
kyma-environment-broker.serviceBindingCleanup.schedule: "0 2,14 * * *"
```

Use the following environment variables to configure the Job:

| Environment Variable | Current Value | Description |
