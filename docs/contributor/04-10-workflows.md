# GitHub Actions Workflows

## Markdown Link Check Workflow

The [`markdown-link-check`](/.github/workflows/markdown-link-check.yaml) workflow checks for broken links in all Markdown files. It is triggered in the following cases:

* As a periodic check that runs daily at midnight on the main branch in the repository
* On every pull request

## Release Workflow

See [Kyma Environment Broker Release Pipeline](04-20-release.md) to learn more about the release workflow.

## Promote KEB to DEV Workflow

The [`promote-keb-to-dev`](/.github/workflows/promote-keb-to-dev.yaml) workflow creates a PR to the `management-plane-charts` repository with the given KEB release version. The default version is the latest KEB release.

## Create and Promote Release Workflow

The [create-and-promote-release](/.github/workflows/create-and-promote-release.yaml) workflow creates a new KEB release and then promotes it to the development environment. It first runs the [release workflow](04-20-release.md), and then creates a PR to the `management-plane-charts` repository with the given KEB release version.

## Label Validator Workflow

The [`label-validator`](/.github/workflows/label-validator.yml) workflow is triggered by PRs on the `main` branch. It checks the labels on the PR and requires that the PR has exactly one of the labels listed in the [`release.yml`](/.github/release.yml) file.

## Verify KEB - Go Workflow

The [`run-verify-go`](/.github/workflows/run-verify-go.yaml) workflow calls the reusable [`run-unit-tests-reusable`](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests-reusable.yaml) workflow with unit tests, executes Go-related checks (such as dependency and formatting checks) and runs the Go linter. 

## Verify KEB - Docs Workflow

The [`run-verify-docs`](/.github/workflows/run-verify-docs.yaml) workflow verifies that the documentation describing environment variables is up to date.
It uses the [`scripts/python/generate_env_docs.py`](../../scripts/python/generate_env_docs.py) script to ensure that environment variable tables in the documentation are up to date with the Helm chart and the `values.yaml` file. The script extracts environment variables from templates, matches them with descriptions and defaults from `values.yaml`, and based on these, updates the relevant Markdown files.

### Add New Files to the Documentation Check

To add a new documentation file to the `run-verify-docs` check, perform the following steps:

1. Add the template and the corresponding Markdown file to the `SINGLE_JOBS`, `MULTI_JOBS_IN_ONE_TEMPLATE`, or `COMBINED_JOBS_IN_ONE_MD` lists in `generate_env_docs.py`.
2. Ensure the Markdown file contains a table for environment variables, or a section header where the table should be inserted.
3. The script automatically updates the documentation table when run.

Run the script with the following command:

```sh
python3 scripts/python/generate_env_docs.py
```

## Govulncheck Workflow

The [`run-govulncheck`](/.github/workflows/run-govulncheck.yaml) workflow runs the Govulncheck.

## Image Build Workflow

The [`pull-build-images`](/.github/workflows/pull-build-images.yaml) workflow builds images.

## KEB Chart Install Test

The [`run-keb-chart-integration-tests`](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-integration-tests.yaml) workflow calls the [`run-keb-chart-integration-tests-reusable`](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-integration-tests-reusable.yaml) reusable workflow to install the KEB chart with the new images in the k3s cluster.

## Auto Merge Workflow

The [`auto-merge`](/.github/workflows/auto-merge.yaml) workflow enables the auto-merge functionality on a PR that is not a draft.

## All Checks Passed Workflow

The [`pr-checks`](/.github/workflows/pr-checks.yaml) workflow checks if all jobs, except those excluded in the workflow configuration, have passed. If the workflow is triggered by a PR where the author is the `kyma-gopher-bot`, the workflow ends immediately with success.

## Validate Database Migrations Workflow

The [`pull-validate-schema-migrator`](/.github/workflows/pull-validate-schema-migrator.yaml) workflow runs a validation of database migrations performed by Schema Migrator.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the code
2. Invokes the [validation script](/scripts/schemamigrator/validate.sh)

## Upload Release Logs as Assets Workflow

The [`upload-release-logs`](/.github/workflows/upload-release-logs.yaml) workflow uploads the logs from the release workflow as assets to the corresponding GitHub release. It is triggered on every published release event.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Waits for the "Create and promote release" workflow to finish if it is still in progress
3. Downloads logs from all attempts of the "Create and promote release" workflow for the current release
4. Uploads the downloaded logs as assets to the current GitHub release
5. Uploads the downloaded logs to a GCP bucket

## Sync KEB Docs Structure Workflow

The [`sync-docs-toc`](/.github/workflows/sync-docs-toc.yml) workflow automatically opens a PR to the `product-kyma-runtime` repository whenever a new or renamed file in KEB's `docs/` directory contains the `<!--{"metadata":{"publish":true}}-->` metadata.
These documents are published to the Restricted Markets documentation. Content edits to existing files require no action — `product-kyma-runtime` pulls the latest content automatically using a `fileTree` reference in its `manifest.yaml`.
The workflow is triggered after every successful [Promote KEB to DEV](#promote-keb-to-dev-workflow) workflow run.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Resolves the current and previous KEB release tags to determine the diff range
2. Detects added or renamed `.md` files in `docs/` between the two releases, filtered by `publish:true` metadata
3. Fetches the corresponding chart version from `management-plane-charts` (falls back to searching merged PRs if the release branch was already deleted)
4. Updates `docs/toc.yaml` in `product-kyma-runtime` using the [`scripts/python/update_toc.py`](../../scripts/python/update_toc.py) script, which inserts new entries in numeric-prefix order and updates the renamed ones
5. Opens a PR to `product-kyma-runtime` with the title `docs(keb): sync doc structure changes [chart@<version>]`

If no relevant changes are detected, the workflow exits early and no PR is created.

## Reusable Workflows

There are reusable workflows created. Anyone with access to a reusable workflow can call it from another workflow.

### Unit Tests

The [`run-unit-tests-reusable`](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests-reusable.yaml) workflow runs the unit tests.
No parameters are passed from the calling workflow.
The end-to-end unit tests use a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container as the default storage solution, which allows
the execution of SQL statements during these tests. You can switch to in-memory storage 
by setting the **DB_IN_MEMORY_FOR_E2E_TESTS** environment variable to `true`. However, by using PostgreSQL, the tests can effectively perform
instance details serialization and deserialization, providing a clearer understanding of the impacts and outcomes of these processes.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks out code and sets up the cache
2. Sets up the Go environment
3. Invokes `make go-mod-check`
4. Invokes `make test`

### KEB Chart Integration Tests

The [`run-keb-chart-integration-tests-reusable`](/.github/workflows/run-keb-chart-integration-tests-reusable.yaml) workflow installs the KEB chart in the k3s cluster. It also provisions, updates, and deprovisions an instance. You pass the following parameters from the calling workflow:

| Parameter name        | Required | Description                                             | Defaults  |
|-----------------------|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------|:---------:|
| **last-k3s-versions** | no       | Number of most recent k3s versions to be used for tests | `1`       |
| **release**           | no       | Determines if the workflow is called from release       | `true`    |
| **version**           | no       | Chart version                                           | `0.0.0.0` |

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Sets up a k3s cluster with required dependencies and installs the KEB chart
2. Starts provisioning the first instance and waits for it to complete successfully
3. Updates the first instance to verify that update operations work correctly
4. Provisions a second instance to begin testing binding rotation
5. Provisions a third instance to verify that multiple instances can share the same binding
6. Provisions a fourth instance to test binding rotation when the limit is reached
7. Verifies that instances 1-3 share the same binding and instance 4 gets a different binding
8. Deprovisions the second instance to free up a binding slot
9. Provisions a fifth instance to verify it reuses the freed binding slot
10. Updates the first instance with a new global account ID
11. Verifies the global account ID propagates correctly to Runtime, Kyma, and GardenerCluster custom resource labels
12. Deprovisions the first instance to validate cleanup processes
13. Checks KEB logs for errors and warnings after each major operation

### Performance Tests

The [`run-performance-tests-reusable`](/.github/workflows/run-performance-tests-reusable.yaml) workflow runs performance tests on the k3s cluster. You pass the following parameters from the calling workflow:

| Parameter name                              | Required | Description                                                         | Defaults  |
|---------------------------------------------|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------:|
| **release**                                 |    no    | Determines if the workflow is called from release                   |  `true`   |
| **version**                                 |    no    | Chart version                                                       | `0.0.0.0` |
| **instances-number**                        |    no    | Number of instances to be provisioned                               |   `100`   |
| **updates-number**                          |    no    | Number of updates on a single instance                              |   `300`   |
| **kim-delay-seconds**                       |    no    | Time to wait before transitioning the runtime CR to the Ready state |    `0`    |
| **provisioning-max-step-processing-time**   |    no    | Max time to process a step in provisioning queue                    |   `30s`   |
| **provisioning-workers-amount**             |    no    | Number of workers in provisioning queue                             |   `25`    |
| **update-max-step-processing-time**         |    no    | Max time to process a step in update queue                          |   `30s`   |
| **update-workers-amount**                   |    no    | Number of workers in update queue                                   |   `25`    |
| **deprovisioning-max-step-processing-time** |    no    | Max time to process a step in deprovisioning queue                  |   `30s`   |
| **deprovisioning-workers-amount**           |    no    | Number of workers in deprovisioning queue                           |   `25`    |

The workflow performs the following actions for all jobs:

1. Fetches the **last-k3s-versions** tag versions of k3s releases
2. Prepares the **last-k3s-versions** k3s clusters with the Docker registries using the list of versions from the previous step
3. Creates required namespaces
4. Installs required dependencies by the KEB chart
5. Installs the KEB chart in the k3s cluster using `helm install`
6. Waits for the KEB Pod to be ready
7. Populates database with a thousand instances
8. Starts metrics collector
