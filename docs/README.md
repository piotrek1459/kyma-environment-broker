# Kyma Environment Broker

Kyma Environment Broker (KEB) is a component that enables you to provision SAP BTP, Kyma runtime in clusters provided by third-party providers. In the process, KEB first uses Kyma Infrastructure Manager (KIM) to create a cluster. Then, it uses Kyma Lifecycle Manager (KLM) to install Kyma runtime in the cluster.
